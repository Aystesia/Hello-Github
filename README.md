# Hello-Github
The first(test) repository I created on Github on 2024.7.11
To have a better understanding of computer language and how to ask of help about coding on Internet, I get down to learn about how to use Github as a bridge between my own study and the general public.	
Hope I'll master python or other language to help with my life!
